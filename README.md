# IFS-IEM
An Interpretable Feature Selection Method Integrating Ensemble Models for Chiller Fault Diagnosis

The following FSMs were selected for comparison with our IFS-IEMï¼š
- Mutual Information (MI)
- Feature Importance (FI)
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR)
- Back-tracing sequential forward feature selection (BT-SFS)
- ReliefF-RFECV

The models include SVM, KNN, DT, DBN, DNN, CNN, RF, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM were used for fault diagnosis performance testing.
